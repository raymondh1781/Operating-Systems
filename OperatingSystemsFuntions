There are many operating system funtions, but one i will talk about here is relationship communication.
The operating system on whatever you are using needs to be in control of absolutely everything.
To do this, the system has direct lines of communication to all the different managers that handle the bulk of the work that needs to be done.
To operate as efficiently as possible, the OS and the managers need to be able to talk together to proceedd therough the workload without hitches or other problems.
